"""Writes the drop shadow texture the addon ships (Media/Shadow.tga).
No dependencies beyond the standard library.

512 x 32, uncompressed 32-bit TGA, black, the shadow in the alpha
channel, rows stored bottom to top (the TGA default). Sixteen 32 x 32
cells side by side. Each cell is the top-left corner piece of a soft
shadow around a rounded rectangle: the rounded corner's centre is the
cell's bottom-right corner, the shadow is full up to the distance
q * 32 from it (the rectangle's own radius) and fades out to nothing at
the distance 32. Cell k has q = k / 16, so one cell fits any ratio of
corner radius to shadow size: the fade always starts at the radius and
is always as wide as the shadow (Core/Border.lua picks the cell).

Cell 0 (q = 0) is a square corner; its right column and bottom row are
the plain fade across the shadow, which the edge pieces use.

Run from the repository root:  python3 tools/make_shadow.py
The output is deterministic; re-running it must not change the file.
